Element for Nextcloud allows you to install Element easily through Nextcloud and join the Matrix decentralized communication network.

This app does not include a Matrix server, only the client. You will have to either set up your own Matrix homeserver, rent one, or use a public one.

This project is not affiliated, associated, authorized, endorsed by, or in any way officially connected with Element or the Element project, or any of its subsidiaries or its affiliates.

The name Element as well as related names, marks, emblems and images are registered trademarks of their respective owners.
